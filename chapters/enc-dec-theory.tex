\section{Encoding \& Decoding Data Simulation}
\label{sec:enc-dec-theory}

	All of the coding schemes as discussed in \autoref{sec:CDMA} are designed for wireless transceivers.
	Meaning they send a radiowave through the air which is encoded with that particular code sequence.
	That radiowave is an analog signal and can vary between $+1$ and $-1$.
	But the VLC enabled LEDs cannot send such signals.
	They can only be turned on or off, thus encoding only $0$ and $1$ symbols.
	Those symbols correspond to a current draw of the LED which is measured by an ADC for example.
	To experiment with the encoding and decoding process and obstacles without the need for hardware and such, we use Matlab to simulate the process.
