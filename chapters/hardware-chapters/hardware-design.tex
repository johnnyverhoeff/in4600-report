\chapter{Hardware Design}
\label{chp:hardware-design}




The codes that will be assigned to each LED have now been introduced.
Now, hardware is needed to put the theory of those codes into practice.
Since hardware will never behave exactly like the software simulations, this chapter will discuss the existing hardware that is out there.
Then, the shortcomings of the hardware are highlighted and custom hardware is introduced.
First the DC case is considered and then the AC case.
