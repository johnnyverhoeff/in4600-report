\subsection{Modulator}	
\label{subsec:ac-modulator}

The job of the modulator in an AC environment, is the same as in a DC environment.
Just like in the DC environment, when a `0' has to be encoded the current should be zero and when a `1' has to be encoded the current should be some constant value.
The transition between a `0' and `1' should be fast, so that a square wave is created, just like in the DC case.

If the translation is done in this manner, the mapping between the code sequence symbols and the current is clear and the aggregated current drawn by multiple lights will also be a square wave, which will allow for decoding the information.
Next, existing hardware is investigated if these solutions will translate the IDs into a current draw which is similar to what has just been discussed above.
