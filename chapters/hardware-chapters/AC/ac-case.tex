\section{AC Environment}
\label{sec:ac-environment}




The translation from an ID, that is assigned to a light fixture, to a unique current signature is more difficult in an AC environment compared to the DC environment.
This is due to the supplied voltage.
In a DC environment, the voltage is a constant value, but in an AC environment the supplied voltage is a sinusoidal wave.
This means that the voltage will be both positive and negative.
In the Netherlands the AC has an RMS voltage of 230 V and a frequency of 50 Hz.

In the next subsections, we will first describe existing hardware and their limitations.
Then new hardware is proposed to solve the limitations of the existing hardware.
Finally, the AC testbed is showcased.
