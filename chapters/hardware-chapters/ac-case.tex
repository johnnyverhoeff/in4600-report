\section{AC Environment}
\label{sec:ac-environment}

In an AC environment, the power supply does not deliver a constant voltage.
It is a sine wave which goes from a positive voltage to a negative voltage and back again.
In the Netherlands, the RMS voltage is 230 V with a frequency of 50 Hz.
In each subsection first existing hardware will be discussed and its flaws for our purpose will be highlighted.
Then new hardware is proposed to remedy these flaws.
Finally a testbed will be showcased.





\subsection{Modulator}	

SMPS, figures ... wont work super imposed.

New hardware which fill exactly do what we require:


	\subsubsection{Triggering}
	LEDs require a certain voltage before current starts flowing.

	circuit....



	\subsubsection{Non-intrusive Voltage Source}
	The above circuit needs a 5v power supply optocouplers blabla.
	below the cerrtain voltage this voltage source will operate, charing cap.


	\subsubsection{Current Source}

	Current source to modulate the led with optocoupler for safe interavtion with uC.


\subsection{Current Sampler}

hall effect too noisy, not so sensitive.
negative current, adding constant voltage to the drawn current
external ADC -> SPI -> isolation -> uC


\subsection{Testbed}
