\section{DC Environment}
\label{sec:dc-environment}





In a DC environment, the code framework works well because the DC power signal is an easy signal to understand and work with.
For example, in \autoref{fig:dc-voltage-and-current-example} the voltage output of a DC power supply can be seen.
A load is switched on and off, and the current that flows over time can also be seen in the figure.
This switching causes the current to be a square wave with sharp edges.
The current is zero when the load is off and the current is a constant value for when the load is on.
This is the signal for one load.
If multiple of these current signatures will be aggregated, it will still be a square wave without distortions.

This is the ideal way the modulator for an LED must work.
In the next sections, the hardware for the modulator will be explained as well as how the current will be measured to extract the encoded information and finally a testbed will be presented.
