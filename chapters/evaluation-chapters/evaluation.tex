\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chp:evaluation}


In this chapter the designed hardware and software will be evaluated, for both the DC and the AC testbeds.
After that, simulation will evaluate the scalability of the setups.

When there is a system for which we can classify the results as false/true-positives and false/true-negatives, we can evaluate the system's performance by investigating the precision and recall.
The definitions of precision and recall can be found in \autoref{eq:precision} and \autoref{eq:recall} respectively, where $tp$ stands for the number of true-positives, $fp$ stand for the number of false-positives and $fn$ stand for the number of false-negatives.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:precision}
	\text{Precision } = \frac{tp}{tp + fp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:recall}
	\text{Recall } = \frac{tp}{tp + fn}
\end{equation}

This method provides two metrics to consider.
Ideally we want only one metric to consider and draw conclusion based on that.
We can take the weighted average of the two metrics.
This is called the F-measure \cite{sokolova2009systematic} and is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.
The definition of the F-measure can be seen in \autoref{eq:F-measure}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:F-measure}
	F = 2 \times \frac{\text{precision} \times \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}
\end{equation}
