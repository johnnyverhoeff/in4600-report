\section{Hardware}
\label{sec:hardware-evaluation}

The following two section will describe the evaluation of the designed hardware and software.
All attached LEDs will be modulating with a different Gold code per LED, from the same set.
The raw ADC signal will be showed as well as the steps to process that signal to be able to do correlation calculations with, if necessary.
Next, the correlation graph will be showed for a Gold code that is present in the received signal as well as the correlation graph for a Gold code from the same set which is not present in the received signal.
Finally the F-measure will be showed for these correlation graphs.
