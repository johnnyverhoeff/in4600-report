\section{Encoding \& Decoding in Practice}
\label{sec:enc-dec-practice}

	To test the codes and the decoding/encoding schemes in practice, it was decided not to tackle the most difficult case first, i.e. the asynchronous AC case.
	But rather start with synchronous DC case.
	To test all of the DC cases, a testbed had to be created.
	This testbed consists of three high-power LEDs with three independent current sources to drive them at a constant current.
	The current sources can be turned on and off with with an Arduino.
	The schematic, pcb and photos can be seen in \autoref{app:dc-testbed}.
