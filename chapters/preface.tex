This Master thesis is the final part of the Master of Science in the Embedded Systems program I followed at Delft University of Technology.
Prior to this thesis, I had little knowledge of VLC or energy disaggregation.
Using VLC in combination with energy disaggregation has not been explored yet.
The first steps towards disaggregating individual lights are taken in this thesis.
There are experimental results achieved as well as theoretical results.

First, I would like to thank my loving family, who have supported me throughout this nine-month thesis project.
I would also like to thank my advisor Marco Z\'u\~niga Zamalloa and Akshay Narashiman for their guidance to help me finish my thesis.
Finally I want to acknowledge Koen Langendoen and Laura Ramirez Elizondo for being members of my graduation committee.
