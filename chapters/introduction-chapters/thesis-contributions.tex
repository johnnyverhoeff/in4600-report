\section{Thesis Contributions}

The aim of this thesis is to propose a combination of hardware and software, so that lights with similar power draw can be distinguished with a single smart-meter.
This thesis takes advantage of advances in two areas: Smartgrid and VLC.

The specific contributions of this thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Coding methods are introduced to allow LEDs to communicate via VLC but also control the power they draw, so that the aggregated power consumption can be disaggregated in such a way that it is clear which LED is on and which is off.

	\item Hardware is proposed to allow for the LEDs to propagate their unique signature via either AC or DC. This will be called the modulator. Other hardware is proposed to interpret the aggregated signal from all the LEDs. This signal consists of the superimposition of all these unique signatures. This will be called the smart-meter.

	\item An evaluation of the proposed hardware and software is carried out, with a testbed and real setup with actual consumer LED light fixtures. For larger scale evaluations, software simulation is used. 
\end{itemize}
