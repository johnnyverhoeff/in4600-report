\section{Thesis Organization}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows.
First the related work and the new proposed method is discussed in \autoref{chp:related-work}.
Then the design requirements are outlined in \autoref{chp:design-requirements}.
In \autoref{chp:cdma} the theory about code sequences is explained.
Next, in \autoref{chp:hardware-design}, the existing hardware and the design of the new hardware is discussed.
In \autoref{chp:evaluation} the hardware and software is evaluated for small scale scenarios and simulations are shown for large scale scenarios.
Finally the work is concluded in \autoref{chp:conclusionsandfuturework} and future work is identified.
