\subsection{Comparison of Sequences}
\label{subsec:comparison-of-sequences}


In \autoref{tbl:comparison-sequences} a comparison is made among the CDMA sequences discussed.
The sequences are compared for the metrics discussed in \autoref{sec:performance-metrics-cdma} in both synchronous as well as asynchronous environments.
From this table it is clear that the Gold sequences are the best sequences suited for the environment of disaggregating individual lights, due to their asynchronous nature, low cross-correlation, auto-correlation with only one peak and the codes scale linearly.
