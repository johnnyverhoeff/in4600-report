\chapter{Code Division Multiple Access}
\label{chp:cdma}

\todo{Should I explain differences TDM/FDM/CDMA ??}


Each LED requires a unique ID.
When the LEDs are modulating to transmit their IDs, the current of multiple LEDs are aggregated.
The aggregated current will flow through the smart-meter, in other words, the only information the  smart-meter has, is the aggregated current.
And from these aggregated IDs, the smart-meter should be able to identify which IDs are present.
If it can do that, the smart-meter is able to tell which LEDs are on and which or off.

This chapter will explain how these IDs can be constructed by using CDMA codes.
To see which codes are the best, first the performance metrics are explained.
Then several codes will be discussed and the performance metrics for each code will be highlighted.
Finally the codes will be compared to each other.
