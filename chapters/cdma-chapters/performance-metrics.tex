\section{Performance Metrics of a CDMA Sequence}
\label{sec:performance-metrics-cdma}

To be able to objectively determine which code sequence is the best for certain environments, metrics are needed to compare the performance of a sequence.
Such metrics are: auto- and cross-correlation, length of the code and how many unique codes can be produced which are in the same set, meaning with the same length, so that they can be used together in the same system.
Also if the codes can be used in a synchronous only or in an a-synchronous environment has to be considered.


Correlation is a measure for determining how much sequence $X$ is similar to sequence $Y$ and can be found in \autoref{eq:correlation}.
With $L$ being the length of the code and $\tau$ the time-shift.
When sequence $X$ and $Y$ are the same sequence, we speak of the autocorrelation.
When they are two different sequences, we speak of the cross-correlation. 

\begin{equation}
	R(\tau)_{xy} = \displaystyle\sum_{i = 0} ^ {L - 1} x(i) \times y(i + \tau) {\text{  with $\tau = 0, 1, 2, \dotsc, L$}}
	\label{eq:correlation}
\end{equation}


%commented out because this will never be used and therefor only adds unnecessary text

%Another way to calculate the correlation between two sequences is to count the number of agreements and disagreements between the two sequences, see \autoref{eq:correlation-a-d}, this comes in handy when comparing two digital sequences, which both have $0$ and $1$ signal levels.

%\begin{equation}
%	R(\tau) = \text{\# of agreements} - \text{\# of disagreements} 
%	\label{eq:correlation-a-d}
%\end{equation}




The properties of an ideal set of codes should be, that the autocorrelation for each code in the set should be $0$ for each time-shift $\tau \neq 0$, at $\tau = 0$ the autocorrelation should be $L$, this value would than be a peak value for which we can identify if this code is present in the received signal.
If the signal is the sampled current and the code is the ID of a LED, then we can say the LED is on when the auto-correlation peak is seen.
The ideal cross-correlation properties should be $0$ for every time-shift $\tau$, so that no code interferes with any other code, hereby causing no MAI (Multiple Access Interference).



The length of a code is also of importance, because each chip of the code has to be transmitted.
Assuming a constant modulating frequency, the time it takes to transmit a code sequence is proportional to the length of that code sequence.
The length of the code will also determine, to some extent, the number of codes in the same set.
The number of codes in the same set determines the scalability of the system.
