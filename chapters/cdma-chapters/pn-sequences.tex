\section{Pseudorandom Noise Sequences}
\label{sec:pn-sequences}

PN sequences are sequences which look like they are randomly generated but they are easily generated in software or hardware.
They are generated with linear shift registers of length $n$.
The sequences have the following noise-like properties~\cite{mitra2008pseudo}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Balance property:	Any PN sequence of length $L = 2^n - 1$ contains exactly $2^{n-1}$ ones and exactly $2^{n-1} - 1$ zeros.

	\item Runs property: A run is a subset of the sequence where all the consecutive numbers are the same. In any PN sequence, $1/2$ of the runs have length 1, $1/4$ have length 2, $1/8$ have length 3 and so on.

	\item Autocorrelation property: The autocorrelation function of a PN sequence will take on two values as can be seen in \autoref{eq:autocorr-pn} and \autoref{fig:autocorr-pn}.


\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:autocorr-pn}
	R(\tau) = 
		\begin{cases}
			L    & \quad \text{if } \tau = 0 \\
			-1   & \quad \text{if } \tau \neq 0 \\
		\end{cases}
\end{equation}

	\label{fig:autocorr-pn}
\end{figure}

PN sequences are generated using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) \cite{Wang:1988:LFS:52007.52024}.
\autoref{fig:lfsr} shows an $n$ length LFSR with XOR gates attached to it.
The LFSR is defined entirely by the feedback function, also called a characteristic polynomial.
It determines the length and the type of sequence generated.
The polynomial looks like \autoref{eq:lfsr-polynomial}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:lfsr-polynomial}
	p(x) = x^n + C_{n-1} x^{n-1}  + C_{n-2} x^{n-2} + \dotsc + C_{2} x^{2}  + C_{1} x  + C_{0}
\end{equation}

For PN sequences, there exists no formula for the cross-correlation of two different PN sequences. 
Exhaustive analysis is required to find out which sequences or entire sets have the cross-correlation characteristics that are good enough for the user's application.
In \autoref{tbl:pn-sequences-C-and-cross-corr} the calculated peak cross-correlations per PN sequences in the same set can be found.



The size of the code set is limited.
For a LFSR with $n$ registers, the maximum number of possible codes $C$ is given by \autoref{eq:num-of-pn-codes} \cite{mutagi1996pseudo}, where $P_i$ are the prime factors of $2^n - 1$ and $\alpha_i$ is the power of $i$th prime factor.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:num-of-pn-codes}
	C = \frac{1}{n} \prod \{ P_{i} ^ {(\alpha_i - 1)} \times (P_i - 1) \}
\end{equation}

For example when using a LFSR of size $n = 6$, $2^n - 1 = 63$, which can be factored into $3^2 \times 7$.
Giving $P_1 = 3$, $P_2 = 7$, $\alpha_1 = 2$ and $\alpha_2 = 1$.
Thus, the maximum number of codes is: $C = \frac{1}{6} \times \{ 3^{2 - 1} \times (3 - 1) \} \times \{ 7^{1 - 1} \times (7 - 1) \} = 6$.
Another example: Say there are going to be 144 user, so 144 codes are needed. 
This means a code length of 4095 chips.
For PN sequences of other lengths, see \autoref{tbl:pn-sequences-C-and-cross-corr} for the number of codes.


\begin{table}[tbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{  | l | l | l | }

		\hline
		Code Length (L)	& Number of Codes (C) 	& Peak cross-correlation	\\ \hline
		
		7				& 2						& 5						\\ \hline					
		15				& 2						& 9						\\ \hline			
		31				& 6						& 11					\\ \hline			
		63				& 6						& 23					\\ \hline		
		127				& 18					& 41					\\ \hline		
		255				& 16					& 95					\\ \hline	
		511				& 48					& 113					\\ \hline	
		1023			& 60					& 383					\\ \hline		
		2047			& 176 					& 287					\\ \hline		
		4095			& 144					& 144					\\ \hline		


	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Table showing the number of PN sequences of the same length along with the peak cross-correlation \cite{kettunen1997code}. }
	\label{tbl:pn-sequences-C-and-cross-corr}

\end{table}


To conclude: PN sequences have less number of sequences in the same set, compared to orthogonal sequences.
But the auto- and cross-correlation are better than those of the orthogonal sequences.
And these auto- and cross-correlation numbers also hold when the sequences are sent a-synchronously.










\subsection{Gold Sequences}
\label{subsec:gold-sequences}

Gold sequences are a type of PN sequence. 
They are created by using two LFS registers as shown in \autoref{fig:gold-lfsr}.
In this figure there are two vectors $s$ and $t$ and two polynomials $C$ and $D$.
For a sequence to be constructed in this way that is a Gold sequence, only preferred pairs of polynomials can be used \cite{kedia2012comparative}.
When we have the polynomials $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, which are a preferred pair and produce the PN sequences $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively, the resulting set of Gold codes is defined as can be seen in \autoref{eq:gold-def}, where $T^n$ represent the cyclic shift of $n$ bits.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gold-def}
	Gold(d_1, d_2) = \{ d_1, d_2, d_1 \oplus d_2, d_1 \oplus Td_2, d_1 \oplus T^2d_2, \dotsc, d_1 \oplus T^{L - 1}d_2 \}
\end{equation}

The autocorrelation properties of Gold sequences are not as good as that of the PN sequences, as can be seen from \autoref{fig:autocorr-gold}.
The autocorrelation of all the Gold sequences are plotted in \autoref{fig:autocorr-gold-3d} to illustrate the autocorrelation of all sequences look like each other.
Apart from the original two PN sequences the autocorrelation values are not two-valued, but are four-valued.
See \autoref{eq:autocorr-gold} and \autoref{eq:gold-t(n)} for the autocorrelation properties of Gold sequences.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:autocorr-gold}
	R(\tau) = 
		\begin{cases}
			L    							& \quad \text{if } \tau = 0 \\
			\{ -t(n), \ -1, \ t(n) - 2  \} 	& \quad \text{if } \tau \neq 0 \\
		\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gold-t(n)}
	t(n) = 
		\begin{cases}
			1 + 2^{\frac{n+1}{2}} & \quad \text{for odd } n \\
			1 + 2^{\frac{n+2}{2}} & \quad \text{for even } n \\
		\end{cases}
\end{equation}

See \autoref{eq:corsscorr-gold} and \autoref{eq:gold-t(n)} for the cross-correlation properties of Gold sequences \cite{mitra2008pseudo}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:corsscorr-gold}
	R_{xy}(\tau) = 	\{ -t(n), -1, t(n) - 2  \} 
\end{equation}


From these equations it is clear to see that the absolute maximum cross-correlation is bounded by $t(n)$.
See \autoref{tbl:gold-sequences-C-and-cross-corr} for the cross-correlation for different lengths of Gold sequences.


\begin{table}[tbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{  | l | l | l | }

		\hline
		Code Length (L)	& Number of Codes (C) 	& Peak cross-correlation ($|t(n)|$)	\\ \hline
		
		7				& 9						& 5						\\ \hline					
		31				& 33					& 9						\\ \hline			
		63				& 65					& 17					\\ \hline			
		127				& 129					& 17					\\ \hline	
		511				& 513					& 33					\\ \hline

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Table showing the number of Gold sequences of the same length along with the peak cross-correlation. }
	\label{tbl:gold-sequences-C-and-cross-corr}

\end{table}

As seen from \autoref{tbl:gold-sequences-C-and-cross-corr} the scalability of the Gold sequences is good.
With a LFSR of length $n$, the sequence length is $L = 2^n - 1$ and the number of sequences is $C = 2^n + 1$.
Compared to the peak cross-correlation of the PN sequences, \autoref{tbl:pn-sequences-C-and-cross-corr}, the peak cross-correlation of the Gold sequences are lower for the same code length, see \autoref{tbl:gold-sequences-C-and-cross-corr}.



% Taken out because this is not used anywhere....

%When $n$ is chosen to be odd, something can be said about the approximate frequency of occurrence of the cross-correlation values, see \autoref{tbl:freq-occurence-gold-cross-correlation} \cite{holmes2007spread}.

%\begin{table}[h]
%	\centering
%	\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
%
%		\hline
%		$R_{xy}(\tau)$ 	& Frequency of occurrence	\\ \hline
%
%		$-1$			& 0.5					 	\\ \hline
%		$-t(n)$			& 0.25						\\ \hline

%\end{table}



Not all Gold sequences have the balance property that the PN sequences do have.
Roughly half of the sequences in the same set are balanced, sometimes this can be as high as three quarters \cite{holmes2007spread}.


To conclude: The cross-correlations of the Gold sequences are better than those of the PN sequences.
Also the scalability is better and the sequences can still be used for a-synchronous transmission.

\todo{Also state that this is extra good, because the LEDs/transmitters cannot be synchronized ???}
